# Time Complexity (TC): O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
#    - We visit each cell in the grid once to count the neighbors, resulting in O(m * n).
# Space Complexity (SC): O(1) since the board is modified in place and no extra space is used apart from variables.

# Approach:
# 1. For each cell in the board, count its neighbors that are alive (including cells that are marked as "will die").
#    - We use the `countNeighbours` helper function to count neighbors by iterating over the 8 possible neighbors.
# 2. To mark state transitions:
#    - Mark a live cell (1) that stays alive as 3 (will stay alive).
#    - Mark a dead cell (0) that becomes alive as 2 (will become alive).
# 3. After processing the board, go through it again and finalize the state transitions:
#    - Convert cells marked as 3 back to 1 (alive).
#    - Convert cells marked as 2 to 1 (alive).
#    - Convert live cells (1) that should die to 0.
